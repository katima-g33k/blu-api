# BLU API

## Introduction
This API is used for the [BLU desktop app](https://github.com/katima-g33k/blu-desktop)

## About the BLU
This project started to refresh the current, but outdated, system in place at my college for our used book sell. At the beginning of each semester students can come and drop their old books to sell them. All the money is given back to the students who sold the books. This is a great way to recycle books and to diminish the costs of higher education.

For more information on the BLU, please refer to the [Student Council (AÃ‰CS) website](http://aecs.info)
